#Q1: What is an Expert System?
#A: An expert system is a computer program that mimics human expert decision-making ability. It uses a knowledge base and inference rules to make recommendations or solve problems in a specific domain.

#Q2: Which type of AI is this project based on?
#A: This is a rule-based expert system — a form of symbolic AI or classical AI.

#Q3: What is the inference mechanism used?
#A: Simple pattern matching: It checks the user’s input (domain of interest) against predefined rules in the knowledge base and returns recommendations.

#Q4: How is this different from a general chatbot?
#A: This system is domain-specific and makes intelligent recommendations, while general chatbots are designed for broad, often conversational tasks.

#Q5: Can this be extended with machine learning?
#A: Yes, instead of static rules, book preferences can be learned from user data using supervised learning models.

#Expert System: A software system using a knowledge base of human expertise to solve problems.

#Components:

#Knowledge Base: Facts and rules (book recommendations here).

#Inference Engine: Applies rules to facts (pattern matches domain).

#User Interface: Text-based interaction.

#This system is a Knowledge-Based Expert System, specifically a rule-based recommender designed to assist library users in selecting relevant books for their academic projects.
